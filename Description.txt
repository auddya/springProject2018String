Simulation of a Vibrating String:

This project is aimed at solving a simple one dimensionsal wave equation, which we are specifying here as a 
vibrating string fixed at both ends. We intend to simulate this system varying certain key parametrs which 
influence oscillations.

One of the most simple techniques to visualise a simulation which involves solving a PDE with certain
boundary conditions is to save a string profile for certain time intervals and plot them agaisnt appropiate axes.
One of the most fundamental conditions required to initialise a vibration is to pluck it at some point which
generates the wave. After this at every time interval the old and new profiles of the string is updated through
an iteration. The output we intend to achieve is to visualise the wave pattern with varying frequencies and modes.
